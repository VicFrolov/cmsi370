\section{Introduction}
Tweet District is an app that lets you find and interact with hundreds of tweets in your area (or any location of your choosing), and provides a way to find out about parties, local events, sales, promotions, and job hirings, and it's all shown on a map. Although it is currently a web app, it's use would be far greater on a mobile device. The purpose of this paper is to come up with a dream interface for this app, and use it as a guide during future development. Interaction design principles and theories are imperative to its development, and will range from usability measures, mental models, and many others.
